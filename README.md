![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57611ef-f749-42b8-9d40-f986f368fabf)

Overload the **draw()** method in the **Circle class** by creating four versions:

1. A method without parameters.
2. A method with one parameter **color** of type **String**.
3. A method with one parameter **scale** of type **float**.
4. A method with two parameters: **color** of type **String** and **scale** of type **float**

> For correct passing of all tests don't use the print() and println() methods in the code.
